ParlaMint-GB_2015-05-19-commons.u1	I have to report that this House has been in the House of Lords where Her Majesty, by Her Royal Commissioners, has been pleased to approve the choice made of myself for the Office of Speaker. I have, in your name and on your behalf, made claim by humble petition to Her Majesty to all your ancient and undoubted rights and privileges, particularly to freedom of speech in debate, freedom from arrest, and freedom of access to Her Majesty whenever occasion shall require, and that the most favourable construction shall be put upon all proceedings. All these Her Majesty, by Her Commissioners, has been pleased to confirm in as ample a manner as they have ever been granted or confirmed by Herself of by any of Her Royal Predecessors My first duty to the House is to report my respectful acknowledgement and grateful thanks for the great honour you have conferred upon me in placing me in the Chair.
ParlaMint-GB_2015-05-19-commons.u2	I must now call on the Members of the House, according to the usual custom, to take the Oath of Allegiance or to affirm at the Table of the House, first doing so myself The Speaker first, alone, standing on the upper step of the Chair, made and subscribed the Affirmation required by law.
ParlaMint-GB_2015-05-19-commons.u3	I should remind hon. Members that until they take the Oath or affirm, they must not sit during any debate or vote in any Division of the House, and will not receive any salary The arrangements for swearing in are set out in the Chamber information sheet, and a guidance note is also available from the Table and Vote Offices I propose to call first the Father of the House, the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), then members of the Cabinet, then members of the shadow Cabinet, then all Privy Counsellors not included in those two groups, wherever they may be sitting, and then other Ministers. Thereafter, I shall call other hon. Members according to the Parliament of their first entry, or, for those with broken service, that of most recent entry. The first batch will be those elected in or prior to the 2001-05 Parliament. Thereafter I shall proceed to call Members by successive Parliaments. Realistically, I do not expect to call new Members until tomorrow I propose to remain in the Chair until 5 pm today, and then to return at 5.30 pm and continue until 7 pm if necessary. The House will sit again tomorrow at 11.30 am, on Thursday at 9.30 am, and on Tuesday at 2.30 pm. Tomorrow I propose to be in the Chair for swearing in until 1.30 pm, on Thursday until 11.30 am, and on Tuesday until 3.30 pm. I hope that by next Tuesday afternoon we will have made sufficient progress to enable all Members to swear in who wish to do so. I hope that Members will come forward in an orderly manner I remind Members that the swearing in, as a proceeding of the House, is recorded by the television cameras, and that anything said or done by Members may appear on television or be picked up by microphones. It will assist the broadcasters if new Members state their name and constituency when they come to the Dispatch Box. Progress will depend, of course, on the number of Members wishing to swear in at any particular time.
